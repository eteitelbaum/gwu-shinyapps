The first is a panel where the user can select the indicator that they want to chart and the second is a plot with a slider where users can select the years they want to view. So let's divide the UI into two sections using the `fluidRow()` and `column()` \n\nThe `fluidRow()` function creates horizontal containers while the `column()` function is used to create vertical containers. Since we our app is going to display a single row, we will have just one `fluidRow()` call. Then we can divide that row into two columns using the `column()` function. The first argument in `column()`is the column width. Since column widths in Shiny are based on the Boots Bootstrap 12-wide grid system, our column widths must add up to 12. So let's make our panel for selecting the indicator 4 units wide and the area where we will display the plot 8 units wide. \n\nFrom there, we can define the panel as a `wellPanel()` to give it an inset look and a grey background. We include `selectInput()` to get our dropdown where users can select an indicator from the `vars` list. Let's also use the `helpText()` function to display some instructions regarding how to use the app. \n\nFor the main display section, we are going to have our plot out along with the slider input. We are going to call this input \"range\" and leave the label blank. Then we need to define a min value, a max value and a range for the slider. For `min` and `max`, we will use `start_date` and `end_date`, which we defined earlier in the setup and the combination of these to define the range (`value`). Then we set `width` to 100% because we want the slider to expand to fit the entire width of the plot. `  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nui <- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"FRED Data App\"),\n    \n    fluidRow(\n      \n      # 12 columns on one row: this panel will take 1/3 of it\n      column(4, wellPanel(\n        selectInput(\"indicator\", \"Indicator:\", vars)\n        ),\n      helpText(\"Select an indicator, choose a date range and view the trend. \n               The grey bars represent economic recessions. \n               The data for this app comes from the St. Louis Fed's \n               FRED database.
