The **server function** is where you are going to put the logic and computations of the application. The server function receives input from the user interface, processes it, and generates the corresponding output. It can perform calculations, query databases, apply statistical models, and produce visualizations.\n\n## The Server Function \n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/c4QQElJdNJs title = 'Scatter Plot App Server Function'>}}\n\nThe server function contains three arguments. Two of them (`input` and `output`) are mandatory. `session` is an optional parameter that controls the behavior of the app during the user session that we won't get into here. But we will keep it in the function call for now just to remind us that it is there. \n\nNext we are going to define the output of the app with `output$scatterplot <- renderPlot({})`. This bit of code is going to render a plot and then save it to the output in an object called `scatterplot`. Remember that in the UI, we defined our plot output as `plotOutput(\"scatterplot\")`. This is where that object `scatterplot` is going to come from. \nThe scatter plot is going to be created in two steps. First we are going to reactively retrieve the data each time the user selects new inputs. To do this we are going to use the inputs (`xcol`, `ycol`) from the UI to subset our data frame `demdata`, e.g. `dem_data[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol, \"region\")]`. That is going to create a three-column data frame with the user's selected x variable, y variable and the region coding and store it in an object called `selectedData`.  \n\nFrom there, we take `selectedData` and use it to create a scatter plot with `ggplot2`. This is done in the usual way, except for a couple of things. First, in our `aes()` call we need to use `get()` to specify the x and y variables. `aes()` uses nonstandard evaluation to capture variable names, meaning that the bare column names of the data frame are read directly so that you do not have to explicitly quote the inputs. However, in this case the names of the inputs are being passed as a string from the user. The `get()` function enables us to retrieve the value of an object based on its name. So our `aes()` call will be `aes(x = get(x = input$xcol), y = get(input$ycol)).` \n\nThe other thing we need to do is to add some special code to deal with the x- and y-axis labels because these are going to change every time the user selects a different variable. Here we are going to use the `names()` function to return the names of the the object selected in the `vars` vector of variable names. To make sure we get the right name from the vector, we are going to use the `which()` function. `which()` returns the value that satisfies a given function, in this case the index number of the `vars` vector that matches the user input. So for example, our x label will be defined as `x = names(vars[which(vars == input$xcol)]`. Here the number returned by `[which(vars == input$xcol)]` is going to be used to subset the `vars` list so that x displays the name of the variable selected by the user.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define server logic required to draw a scatter plot\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # Render the plot\n  output$scatterplot <- renderPlot({\n    \n    # ggplot call\n    ggplot(dem_data, aes(x = .data[[input$xcol]], y = .data[[input$ycol]])) +\n      geom_point(aes(color = region)) +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n      scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n      theme_minimal() +\n      labs(\n        x =  names(vars[which(vars == input$xcol)]), # select names in vars that\n        y =  names(vars[which(vars == input$ycol)]), # match input selections\n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\",\n        color = \"Region\"\n      )\n  })\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Displaying your app\n\nAt this point it should be relatively simple to view your app. Just add the call to the Shiny app, e.g. `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)` and click \"Run App\" in RStudio. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# See above for the definitions of ui and server\nui <- ...\n\nserver <- ...\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOptionally, right now, you can try setting up an account on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). Read over the shinyapps.io [user guide](https://docs.posit.co/shinyapps.io/index.html) and see if you can get it to work. For your final project, you will need to be able to deploy your app but but right now it is fine if you only want to view it locally.\n",
